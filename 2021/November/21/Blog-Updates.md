# Blog Timeline

If you've been on the site recently you may have noticed _ALL THE BLOG ARTICLES ARE GONE_.

Well that's because we never set up fetching articles prior to the current month.

That is now fixed! And in addition, a much better control has been implemented to make exploring the article list easier. I like to call it: _the blog timeline_.

Pretty simple concept. A horizontally scrollable widget that let's you navigate, in what will eventually be reverse chronological order, all of the articles in my blog article repository.

When an entry is clicked (clickable area is the `text` portion of the each widget entry, where the date and title of the article are), a preview of the article is loaded in the remainder of the page. To read the full article just click on the bottom of the article where the "Read More" interactive is.

# TODO

- Sort blog timeline entries reverse-chronologically
- Blog placeholder/skeleton areas re-implemented
- Verify behavior of using image references in blog posts
