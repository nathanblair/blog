# New and Shiny

Some good news along with the release of the new Blog Timeline component: I finally got my hands on my new Macbook Pro.

Here's the specs:

- 16"
- M1 Max Apple Silicon chip
- 10-core CPU
- 32-core GPU
- 64 GB RAM
- 1 TB drive

To say I'm excited is an understatement. I've been waiting on the specs in this machine to be in a laptop for 5 years now. Now that its finally here I feel I can actually be fully productive in all of my personal and professional projects.

# Review

I'm not going to dive too deeply into a review. There are plenty of others out there that would be much more extensive than anything I can offer. But for some real-world usage, I can offer this much.

## Development Performance

I made some rough benchmarks shortly after I got everything set up to compare with my Dell XPS 9500; I want to say its an 8750H 6-core chip with 32 GB of RAM.

My results were that I was able to build wheels for the `numpy` and `scipy` Python packages between 80-100% faster, under similar hardware alotments using the `buildx` backend.

While that is exciting for some of my professional tasks, I'm excited for what this has enabled for my personal projects as well. I now have a _beautiful_ screen for developing web components on for my site and my company site. My `go` and `rust` projects compile in virtually 0 time. I have a professional machine that I can start using to build out the offerings of Sonic Original Software.

## Battery

Battery life has been incredible for the amount of power this machine is putting out. With roughly 80% brightness and running Safari, VS Code, `kitty`, and Apple Music, I'm see a solid 11-15 hours of life from 100% -> 20%.

## Sound

I am actually blown away by the quality coming from the speakers on the MBP. When I first used them I legitimately needed to verify the sound was coming from the speakers and not my home theatre system.

I'm not an audiophile by any stretch, and its doubtful I'd use the speakers very often considering most of my work is done at home where I have a whole-home studio system or remotely in various local cafes. But for the occassional times I'm laying bed and just want everything locally run, the quality is very impressive.

## Display

16" is a HUGE screen for a laptop. I have no idea how people manage with 17. But I'm getting old and my eyesight isn't as acute as used to be, so I wanted a larger screen at the cost of some portability. In my younger years, 14" would have been the absolute sweet spot. But now, I don't have to sacrifice being able to read text for being able to have a larger application FOV. That is a HUGE win for my productivity.

## Gaming

I did not buy the computer strictly for gaming usage but I can't deny the specs are crying out to be put through their paces. I don't have much time for gaming but when I do I'm usually on Halo or an Elder Scrolls game. So I threw on Elder Scrolls Online and booted up.

I should mention I had _amazing_ performance I was seeing from my old MacBook Air with an M1 chip on ESO. But with the M1 Max, I'm able to run at 50-90% native display resolution with medium to high graphics and not drop a frame under 100 FPS. Considering how well MBP's are with their display scaling, 50-90% native resolution still looks _very_ good. And so overall, I'd rate the experience a 9/10. My problem now is that I don't have a great dedicated M&K setup to game for extended periods on it.

# Closing Thoughts

I'm greatly looking forward to the work I'm going to be able to get done on this new MBP. Apple has been positively _killing_ it with their hardware lately. So much so that I've completely bought into the ecosystem. Google, if you're reading, fire all of your engineers working on your "Home" products and find ones that can actually get the job done. I'm not kidding. I control my Google Nest devices like cameras better using Apple's Homekit, through a 3rd party, open-source bridge run on a Raspberry Pi, than I do using Google's own various Hubs and Home Minis. Its embarrassing.

More to the point, the MBP 2021 is another data point in a trend showing that Apple is currently crushing the hardware and software performance scene. For all the money this machine cost, I've no doubt it will be worth it for removing myself the headache of having to deal with _Windows 11_, Dell, and _Intel_.
