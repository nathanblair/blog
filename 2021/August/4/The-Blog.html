<p>
  Hosting your blog source files separately from your website source files using
  only <code>git</code> and GitHub Pages - it can't be done!
</p>

<p>
  That's what I was becoming convinced of. I've done some hacking and it turns
  out, with even just a pretty simple logic flow, it <em>can</em> in fact be
  done.
</p>

<h1>The Why</h1>

<p>
  I think we can all agree separation of concern is a good thing; and that its
  much easier to only need to concern yourself with publishing an
  <code>html</code> file rather than an entire website. In addition, blog
  content should be both source-controlled and source-controlled separately from
  the actual website that hosts it.
</p>

<h1>The Flow</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write blog source files and organize them in a directory structure
    representing their date of publish and with a filename that represents their
    title.
  </li>

  <li>
    Source control blog repository in a cloud repository. GitHub works very well
    for this as their API to list directories and grab files from repositories
    is very simple to consume. But I've hacked around to make it work using
    something like Google Firestore as well, and I'm sure S3 buckets could
    potentially work too.
  </li>

  <li>
    Add blog diff, commit, and push your local to your Cloud Host (easier if the
    repository cloud host is also the one serving the files, otherwise you'll
    have to do some more steps to copy the blog articles to your Cloud Storage
    buckets).
  </li>

  <li>
    Publish website that can make API calls to download blog source
    (<code>html</code>) files
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Details</h2>

<h3>Cloud Storage</h3>

<p>
  The first order of business is to create the hosting environment for where the
  blog source (i.e. the <code>html</code>) files will actually reside. This can
  work using Cloud Storage solutions like S3 or Google Firestore but I find its
  most efficient to use a GitHub repository, as their API is very easy to
  consume and no extra steps are needed once the local source control is synced
  with the cloud.
