<p>
  Hosting your blog source files separately from your website source files using
  only <code>git</code> and GitHub Pages - it can't be done!
</p>

<p>
  That's what I was becoming convinced of. I've done some hacking and it turns
  out, with even just a pretty simple logic flow, it <em>can</em> in fact be
  done.
</p>

<h1>The Why</h1>

<p>
  I think we can all agree separation of concern is a good thing; and that its
  much easier to only need to concern yourself with publishing an
  <code>html</code> file rather than an entire website. In addition, blog
  content should be both source-controlled and source-controlled separately from
  the actual website that hosts it.
</p>

<h1>The Flow</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write blog source files and organize them in a directory structure
    representing their date of publish and with a filename that represents their
    title.
  </li>

  <li>
    Source control blog repository in a cloud repository. GitHub works very well
    for this as their API to list directories and grab files from repositories
    is very simple to consume. But I've hacked around to make it work using
    something like Google Firestore as well, and I'm sure S3 buckets could
    potentially work too.
  </li>

  <li>
    Add blog diff, commit, and push your local to your Cloud Host (easier if the
    repository cloud host is also the one serving the files, otherwise you'll
    have to do some more steps to copy the blog articles to your Cloud Storage
    buckets).
  </li>

  <li>
    Publish website that can make API calls to download blog source
    (<code>html</code>) files
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Details</h2>

<h3>Cloud Storage</h3>

<p>
  The first order of business is to create the hosting environment for where the
  blog source (i.e. the <code>html</code>) files will actually reside. This can
  work using Cloud Storage solutions like S3 or Google Firestore but I find its
  most efficient to use a GitHub repository, as their API is very easy to
  consume and no extra steps are needed once the local source control is synced
  with the cloud.
</p>

<aside>
  Discussing setting up for a cloud storage host other than GitHub is outside
  the scope of this blog post. If people are interested in how Google Firestore
  or AWS S3 might work, send me a mention

<h4>GitHub</h4>

<p>
  For GitHub, its a simple matter of creating a repository that's solely meant
  for source-controlling your blog post source files (the
  <code>html</code> files).
</p>

<p>
  This method is most effective (and the assumption throughout the rest of the
  guide) when there is also a directory structure expected. Its very simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Year</code>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Month</code>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>Day</code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>Blog-Post.html</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This will end up with a blog post shown on the website for the date
  <code>${Day} ${Month} ${Year}</code> and the title <b>Blog Post</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to either create the repository in GitHub first and clone it down or
  initialize the local <code>git</code> repo and add the created GitHub remote
  repository to the existing local one.
</p>

<p>
  Make sure you are set to commit and sync to your remote's default branch (I
  simply <code>git config --global init.defaultBranch "default"</code>).
</p>

<p>
  Simply write the <code>Blog-Post.html</code> file at the desired date folder
  structure location,
  <code>git add ${Year}/${Month}/${Day}/Blog-Post.html</code>,
  <code>git commit -m "${YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE}"</code>, and then
  <code>git push</code> (<code>-u ${REMOTE_NAME} ${DEFAULT_BRANCH}</code> if
  you're not already set up to sync to that branch by default).
</p>

<p>
  This takes care of everything that needs to be done to the blog article
  <code>html</code> file itself. With the source now available from a Cloud
  Storage host, we just need to fetch it and insert it into our Blog page.
</p>

<h3>Website Blog Page Logic</h3>

<p>
  The details of this will be very dependent upon how your site is designed and
  what kind of frameworks you use. I can't account for everything in a single
  article so I'll divulge my process while using
  <code><a href="https://svelte.dev/">svelte</a></code> and you can feel free to
  modify the process to fit your needs accordingly.
</p>

<h4>Svelte Pages and Routing</h4>

<p>
  I don't use any extra special <code>svelte</code> frameworks to manage
  single-page routing. I have a <code>blog/index.html</code> path inside my
  hosted root folder, and that <code>index.html</code> file points to the same
  <code>main.js</code> and other assets that my <code>/index.html</code> file
  do. In the end, it ends up just serving my <code>Blog.svelte</code> component.
  To see it in action, check out my
  <code
    ><a
      href="https://github.com/nathanblair/nathanblair.github.io/blob/default/src/App.svelte"
      >App.svelte</a
    ></code
  >
  file and my
  <code
    ><a
      href="https://github.com/nathanblair/nathanblair.github.io/blob/default/src/pages/Blog.svelte"
      >pages/Blog.svelte</a
    ></code
  >
  file.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of that <code>pages/Blog.svelte</code> file, let's dive into what its
  doing to load our Blog articles from the Cloud Storage host.
</p>

<h4><code>pages/Blog.svelte</code></h4>

<p>
  Most of the functionality for network requests is actually handled in a
  <code>Javascript</code> module located in <code>src/blog.js</code>, but let's
  first dive into what must be done from a high-level before digging into the
  implementation details.
</p>

<p>
  One of the first things we need is a DOM element for targeting where to insert
  each Blog Article. For the time being (until I get reverse-chronological
  sorting implemented) I simply target the
  <code>document.getElementById(main_id)</code>. This just appends each Blog
  Article that is fetched as siblings to one another in my DOM's
  <code>main</code> element. It may be appropriate to target your blog articles
  to your <code>document.body</code>.
