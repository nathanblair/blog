<p>
  I want to take a moment to detail my approach to automating my site
  deployment. Because I think its pretty <em>spiffy</em>.
</p>

<p>
  I suppose first and foremost, I'll share why I think its important enough to
  discuss, and then give some background on the branches and their strategy.
</p>

<h2>Why is this significant?</h2>

<p>
  It was my interpretation when I began working with GitHub pages that it should
  serve static content, and that content would sit directly inside the root of
  the directory.
</p>

<p>
  But if you want to use a framework that requires "compilation" to generate
  your front-end UI, you typically "compile" to a target folder. To get this
  folder served by GitHub Pages, you then might instinctively set your GitHub
  Pages to serve from some branch's (probably your repo's default)
  <code>docs</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  This <code>docs</code> directory is hard-coded from GitHub, and may make
  working with your built assets less intuitive.
</p>

<p>
  Coupled with this awkward <code>docs</code> build target folder, now you're
  looking at source controlling built artifacts in the same repo the source to
  generate potentially different artifacts is found in.
</p>

<p><em>No bueno.</em></p>

<p>This workflow skirts around both of these issues.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<h3>Branches</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code>public</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This is the branch that GitHub Pages actually serves. It is
    singly-progressive branch as its contents come from code compiles
  </dd>
  <dt><code>default</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This is the source code branch. Its contents are "compiled" (in the sense
    that any JavaScript can be) and its output goes into a build output folder
    in the <code>public</code> folder
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Strategy</h3>

<p>
  I like to keep my branching and merging strategies as simple as possible. This
  is a great showcase of that in action.
</p>

<p>
  Merges happen "upstream" to the <code>public</code> branch from the
  <code>default</code> branch. So when a PR is closed that merges the
  <code>default</code> branch into the <code>public</code> branch, it signifies
  a release to the live site is intended.
</p>

<h4>How do we accomplish that in GitHub Actions with GitHub Pages?</h4>

<h5>Walkthrough</h5>

<p>The GitHub Actions workflow I've created to deploy the site update:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensures the working directory is clean</li>
  <li>
    Clones in the <code>public</code> branch from the repository into a
    <code>public</code> folder in the working directory
  </li>
  <li>
    Clones in the <code>default</code> branch from the repository into
    <code>site</code> folder in the working directory
  </li>
  <li>
    Performs an <code>npm ci</code> from the <code>site</code> working directory
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>npm run build:prod</code> from the <code>site</code> working directory
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy the
    <code>site/public</code> directory to the target
    <code>public</code> directory
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure git so the changes in the <span class="code">public</span> working
    directory can be committed
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git add --all</code> all of the changes (diff will be applied via
    copied files from the <code>site/public</code> directory) and
    <code>git commit</code> them
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git push</code> that new commit back to the <code>public</code> branch
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Following that, GitHub Pages will now be serving the updating site
  automatically!
